For the first part of my PhD, I am working on improving the reliability of GEDI pairs for assessing structural changes in vegetation due to fires. The goal is to develop a reliable method that can be used to assess the impact of fires on vegetation structure using GEDI data, which is a spaceborne LiDAR mission that provides high-resolution measurements of forest structure.
