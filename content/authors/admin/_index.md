I amdynamic, hardworking, and curious professional with a particular interest in research topics related to environmental health, air quality, data science, and remote sensing. Currently, I am investigating the effects of fires on vegetation structural changes by integrating multiple Earth observation datasets, specifically Spaceborne lidar (GEDI) and multi-frequency radar and optical data. I am passionate about making scientific research reproducible and accessible in non-scientific contexts through the creation of interactive dashboards.
